= Description
  A security library for MS Windows that allows you to open existing or
  create new security identifiers (SID's), as well as create access
  control lists (ACL's).

= Synopsis
  require 'win32/security'
  include Win32
   
  sid = Security::SID.open('some_user')
   
  sid.valid? # => true
  sid.to_s   # => "S-1-5-21-3733855671-1102023144-2002619019-1000"
  sid.length # => 28
  sid.sid    # => "\001\005\000\000\000\000\000\005\025\000\000\000..."

  acl = Security::ACL.new
  mask = Security::ACL::GENERIC_READ | Security::ACL::GENERIC_WRITE

  acl.add_access_allowed_ace('some_user', mask)
  acl.add_access_denied_ace('some_user', Security::ACL::GENERIC_EXECUTE)

  acl.acl_count # => 2
  acl.valid?    # => true
   
== Future Plans
  Create classes that encapsulate ACE's and Tokens.
   
  There is an unfinished versions of the ACE class in the repo if you're
  interested in taking a look.
   
== Known Issues
  None that I'm aware of. Please file any bug reports on the project page at:
